# Q1Project
Q1 project for web development immersive
Tentatively named Furever Homes

My Q1 project will be an app for browsing adoptable dogs. You will be able to search via zip code and a few other search parameters. It will provide info matching your search parameter with pictures, age, a bio and possibly a link to adopt them.

This app solves the problem of linking adoptable dogs to people who want to give them homes

I will be using JS, jQuery, the Petfinder API, Bootstrap, HTML and CSS.

My MVP is having a site that you can search by zip code to find adoptable dogs. I would also like to ideally include the other search parameters but that will be a small stretch goal. My big stretch goal is to inlcude the possibility to adopt them.
